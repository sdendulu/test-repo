## General info
Coronavirus disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was first detected in Wuhan, China in 2019. The disease has impacted over 150 countries and emerged as a global pandemic infecting over 1.5 million patients in the United States as of early June 2020 and the current surge of COVID infection back again is a growing concern. The purpose of the current R project is to find the impact of racial disparities and patient charactertistics such as age, gender, smoking history, obesity and other existing clinical conditions of patients determine the length of hospitalization stay, ventilator utilization and mortality.
